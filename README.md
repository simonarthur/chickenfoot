To build you need:
Ant & Java
Python 2.7.x

Create a firefox.properties as described in firefox-default.properties.

"ant run" will build Chickenfoot and install it to the Firefox profile
you have set up.

Do "ant -p" to see all the build targets.

If you are developing, it's a good idea to also install Venkman to the
profile: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript-debugger/ .
